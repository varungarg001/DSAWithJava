in this lecture 4 we will find out how to convert a number into its corresponding bits and we are using 8 - bits number.
In odd even bits program we know how to print odd and even using modulus operator but in this we see how we can done this using bits operarion.
In find ith bit program we will try to find out the i'th bit of the number.
in set the i'th bit program we will manually set the bit the i'th if it is not set.
in toggle ith bit program, 0->1 , 1->0 basically 1's complement xor will be used.
in unset ith bit program, 1->0,0->0.
in power of two we will do, try to find that given number is power of two or not. by doing num&num-1->0.
in unset rightmost ith bit -> we will unset the right most set bit.
in count the set bit program, we will try to count number of set bit in a number
